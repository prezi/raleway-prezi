OTF font files mostly for print and web design
=============
raleway-prezi


This is the branch with OTF typefaces mostly for print and web design.

Before you install the new version of the family, you need deactivate/remove/delete fonts from system and any other font with the same name. You can do it in Font Book application. Then you need delete everything with Secure Empty trash from your drive. This is the latest, production ready file, but, if you find any issue, or if you have any questions or comments, please let me know. Thx!
