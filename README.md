Font files for design and web embedding
=============
raleway-prezi


This is the branch with OTF and WOFF typefaces for design and web. The OTF files are in **OTF for print** folder and font files for the web embedding are in **WOFF for web** folder.

**OTF files installation:**
Before you install the new OTF version of the family, you need deactivate/remove/delete fonts from system and any other font with the same name. You can do it in Font Book application. Then you need delete everything with Secure Empty trash from your drive. This is the latest, production ready file, but, if you find any issue, or if you have any questions or comments, please let me know.

**Web font files installation:**
If you have installed any previous version, simply remove it and upload the newest ones.

Thats all. Thx!
