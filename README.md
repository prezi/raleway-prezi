First of all, we would say open source thanks.
Prezi is built on and with the aid of several open source projects and we would like to thank the people and projects for helping us achieve our goals. We use a lot of beautiful fonts at Prezi, so we'd like to thank the designers for the use of these great fonts. (https://prezi.com/developers/open-source-thanks/)

For our brand we choose as a brand typeface beautiful Raleway, Pablo Impallari's open source font, and because we have few specific needs (succesfull readabilty), we upgrade, extend and fit the original Raleway to our requirements.


#Raleway Prezi


The **Raleway Prezi** – our branded typeface.

Upgraded, extended and fitted to our requirements – what is this means? So, we:
- changed diacritical marks and punctuation  (we make them bigger,more readable)
- changed deafult a, d, j, l, q, u, w to alternate characters
- changed form of the numbers
- changed default numbers style from old numerals to default set / .onum
- extended with arrows
- extended with uni2318 (Apple Command) character
- created small caps with diacritical marks
- changed default zero to slashed (dotted) zero
- removing ligatures
